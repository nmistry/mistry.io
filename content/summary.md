Working in diverse fields including space exploration, medical technology, speech recognition, and cloud computing, I enjoy exploring the leading edge of technology and delving into its intricacies. As fulfilling as the this pursuit has been, I have also found developing customer relationships is equally satisfying. Creating solutions to difficult problems and cultivating customers are some of the most gratifying elements of my work.  The more challenging the problem, the more rewarding the effort.

Identifying “needs over wants” is fundamental to my process.  Whether it is creating customer / business success, team building, or engineering, I quantify progress by defining metrics to establish a baseline, decoupling these elements while identifying dependencies, and developing a sustainable plan for change.

I enjoy architecting complex & distributed systems, as well as building them; I have experience in multiple programming languages, virtualization technologies, container technologies, and extensive database knowledge.  I enjoy leading teams and working in a close environment - local or remote.

Some of my key career accomplishments include:

1. Pitched, designed and lead the implementation of production hosting platforms at multiple companies.  At Catalyze, this product overtook the flagship offering and resulted in the company value increasing by an order of magnitude.  
2. Completed / passed multiple independent HiTRUST and HIPAA audits, both internal and by customers.
3. Responsible for all customer relationships in the top 25% spend bracket at Catalyze, Inc. In under six months, this sector’s MRR doubled.  
4. Contributed to the very first production-ready public cloud OpenStack deployment.
5. Seamlessly migrated 20,000+ hosts (or approximately 250,000 VMs) worth of cloud servers customers to new hosts due to a Xen Server security vulnerability at Rackspace. Developed automation tools and procedures to reduce the total effort by 75% while ensuring a failure rate of less than 0.05%.
